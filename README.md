# Sokoban

This is a program that allows the user to play the puzzle game Sokoban. The goal is to control the sprite to move the boxes onto the designated targets. 

To play, the board is printed into the shell output, and is reprinted each time after the user makes a move. The board consists of walls (+), the sprite (i), boxes (!), and targets (o). When a box is moved onto a target, the "!" character is changed to a ".", and when the sprite is moved onto a target, the character changes to an "I".

This program was made using Python and can be ran successfully on IDLE with Python 3.10 installed. Before running, ensure that both the **game_settings.py** and **copy.py** files are downloaded.
